# donktuber

A client-side website that turns your voice into an animated slideshow.
It works on the concept that it sets up a picture of your choice
depending on the decibel level of your microphone.

## deploying

Since it's just HTML pages with plain JavaScript,
you can just download the source code and open `index.html`
